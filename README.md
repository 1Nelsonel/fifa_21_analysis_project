# fifa_21-analysis
<b> It is a course project for completion of the course, Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas. FIFA 21 is an association football simulation video
game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series, and was released on 9 October 2020 for 
Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox. The FIFA 21 dataset consists of data of large number of football players. It include the
ratings of the player along with other informations like age, nationality, team, etc. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. Comparison between players based on
ratings, age and potential is made in this project. Graphical visualisation amongst players of different nationality and team is done to get a better 
understanding of the dataset. Numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn python packages are used in this project. The course "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas"
is a great course for a beginner like me. It has helped me understand the basic of functions, methods, variables, datatypes and many more python concepts.
It has also improved my understanding of data analysis concepts. Learning matplotlib and seaborn package and applying all the concepts in the course project is
a great way to sharpen the concepts learned in the course.</b>
